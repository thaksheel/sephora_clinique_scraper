# sephora_clinique_scraper
Codebase with python async web scraper for clinique products on sephora.com and clinique.com websites 

How to use: 
- Start with the cosmetic_scrapper.py which contains all the code to scrape both clinique and sephora's products. The clinique.py, sephora.py, and connect_tables.py are inidividual scripts that were combined in comestic_scrapper.py
- However, this codebase was ran in early May 2025, it might not work if either website did major changes to their website architecture
